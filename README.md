# StructureMap
#STRUCTURE MAP AND INTRODUCTION TO LAMAR
WHAT ? 
    "Structure Map" is a “Dependency Injection / Inversion of Control” tool for .NET that can be used to improve the architectural 
    qualities of an object oriented system by reducing the mechanical costs of good design techniques.
WHY?

     1. StructureMap  can enable loose coupling between classes and    their dependencies 
     2. It improves testability of a class structure, and provide generic flexibility mechanisms.
     3. Used judiciously, StructureMap can greatly enhance the opportunities for code reuse by minimizing direct coupling between 
        classes and configuration mechanisms.
